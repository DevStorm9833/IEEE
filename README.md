Navbar[ Home Events Team LeaderBoard Resources]

👉 Navigation reqd in [2025 Events](https://ieee.dbit.in/2025.html), 2024 etc and all the events under it. [2024 Team](https://ieee.dbit.in/Previous-teams/2024-team.html), 2023, etc


## [Home](https://ieee.dbit.in/)
- CSI & ACM have written in Home page, they both are the LARGEST CHAPTERS in DBIT. 🤣
- Navbar should be shown & it should stick even when we scroll. Logo should fit inside Navbar. 
- When we hover on the Navbar Links, it should change color.
- Instead of showing just DBIT photo, we can show a series of few good event photos. Ref [IEEE Vesit](https://www.ieeevesit.org/)
- And due to the bright bg photo, IEEE DBIT logo isnt that visible. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/)
- Impactful No.s can be shown in the Blue Strip. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/)
- Instead of giving a separate page for About Us we can show it in Home Page.
- Vision Mission Values instead of a simple About Us. Ref [CSI DBIT] 
- What we do? Ref [GDGC DBIT](https://gdgc.dbit.in/)
- Instead of Yearly Events, we should show our Recent & Upcoming Events and a Poster img along with the Event Name, Date in Home page. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/index.html)

## Events
- Under Each Year we should show a Poster img along with the Event Name, Date. Inside it 5-6 Event images, Report. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/events.html)

## Team
- Above the Current Core Team, we can give links to Previous Teams, instead of separate page. Ref [GDGC DBIT](https://gdgc.dbit.in/#/team)

## LeaderBoard
- We can show a Leaderboard of Students earning points due to participation & winning in Events. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/csi-leaderBoard.html)

### Suggestions:
- IEEE DBIT can publish Tech Articles/Blogs in Medium. Ref [IEEE SPIT](https://ieee.spit.ac.in/)
- The Fast moving lines feel wierd. Instead we can put something like dots moving towards us.
- In Events section we should also show Winners of that Event if any.
- We can show a Leaderboard of Students earning points due to participation & winning in Events. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/csi-leaderBoard.html)
