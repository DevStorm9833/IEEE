## Home 
- CSI & ACM have written in Home page, they both are the LARGEST CHAPTERS in DBIT.
- Navbar should be shown & it should stick even when we scroll. Logo should fit inside Navbar.
- Instead of showing just DBIT photo, we can show a series of few good event photos. Ref [IEEE Vesit](https://www.ieeevesit.org/)
- Impactful No.s can be shown in the Blue Strip. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/)
- Instead of giving a separate page for About Us we can show it in Home Page.
- Vision Mission Values instead of a simple About Us. Ref [CSI DBIT] 
- What we do? Ref [GDGC DBIT](https://gdgc.dbit.in/)
- When we hover on Previous Teams we should get the options their only instead of taking to a different page.

### Suggestions:
- IEEE DBIT can publish Tech Articles/Blogs in Medium. Ref [IEEE SPIT](https://ieee.spit.ac.in/)
- The Fast moving lines feel wierd. Instead we can put something else.
- In Events section we should also show Winners of that Event if any.
- We can show a Leaderboard of Students earning points due to participation & winning in Events. Ref [CSI DBIT](https://csi.dbit.in/csi-leaderBoard.html)
